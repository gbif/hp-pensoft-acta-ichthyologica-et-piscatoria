This is Ð° GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Acta Ichthyologica et Piscatoria](https://aiep.pensoft.net/).

**Acta Ichthyologica et Piscatoria** (AIeP) - an international journal for ichthyology and fisheries, is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that publishes articles based on original experimental data or experimental methods, or new analyses of already existing data, in any aspect of ichthyology and fisheries (fin-fish and shell-fish).

We favor articles with an innovative approach, innovative interpretation, interesting justification of the research, and most of all, well fitting into the mainstream science. Such papers should constitute a step in the logical development of a subject and set new pathways for future research. We avoid accepting papers that are "isolated" (i.e., not linked to the "past" and "future" science). Manuscripts not fitting into the above-mentioned description (even those done perfectly in terms of methodology) may be rejected on the grounds of insufficient scientific priority. We discourage the practice of reporting the results of a single study in two or more manuscripts ("salami science").

Please note that some topics have a higher priority for us than others. Additional formal restrictions may apply to certain types of papers. For example, we publish new record papers and LWR papers in the form of short communication only. In the LWR papers, priority is given to submissions containing LWRs of at least ten fish species of which no relevant info is available in FishBase (or the number of available LWRs is very low).
